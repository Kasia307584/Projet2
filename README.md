### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the website depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the page from the menu

### Links

- Live Site URL: [See the live page here](https://kasia307584.github.io/reservia_booking-website/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox and Grid

### What I learned

- Specific use cases for `CSS Flexbox and Grid`(e.g., using Grid to devide the screen to blocs and Flex to control the behaviour of elements inside those blocs depending on viewport)
- `media-queries` for responsive website
- The concept of inheritance in CSS
- The specificity of selectors in CSS
- Choosing size units for HTML elements
- Use of icons (`Font Awesome`) and fonts (`Google Fonts`)
- Structure CSS code - good practices (general elements at the beginning, grouping elements with the same properties, dividing code by page sections and media queries)
- CSS debugging with `Chrome DevTools`
- Using the `W3C HTML validator` to check for errors and warnings
- Using `Git` and `GitHub` for code version control
- Deployment to `GitHub Pages`

### Continued development

- Implement the BEM methodology in HTML elements
- Use CSS custom properties (CSS variables) especially for colors and fonts throughout the website
- Change CSS class names from French to English
- Restyle using Sass
- Rebuild the project in React
