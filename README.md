### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the website depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the page from the menu

### Links

- Live Site URL: [See the live page here](https://kasia307584.github.io/reservia-booking-website/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3 Flexbox and Grid

### What I learned

- specific use cases for `CSS Flexbox` and `CSS Grid`(e.g., using Grid to devide the screen to blocs and Flexbox to control the behaviour of elements inside those blocs depending on viewport)
- `media-queries` for responsive website
- the concept of inheritance in CSS
- the specificity of selectors in CSS
- choosing size units for HTML elements (px, %, em, rem)
- use of icons (`Font Awesome`) and fonts (`Google Fonts`)
- structure CSS code - good practices (general elements at the beginning, grouping elements with the same properties, dividing code by page sections and media queries)
- CSS debugging with `Chrome DevTools`
- using the `W3C HTML validator` to check for errors and warnings
- using `Git` and `GitHub` for code version control
- deployment to `GitHub Pages`

### Continued development

- implement the BEM methodology in HTML elements
- use CSS custom properties (CSS variables) especially for colors and fonts throughout the website
- change CSS class names from French to English
- restyle using Sass
- rebuild the project in React
